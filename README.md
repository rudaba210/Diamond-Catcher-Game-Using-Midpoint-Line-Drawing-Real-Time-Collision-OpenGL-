# Diamond-Catcher-Game-Using-Midpoint-Line-Drawing-Real-Time-Collision-OpenGL-
This program implements a 2D diamond-catching game using OpenGL, where a falling diamond accelerates over time and is caught using a movable catcher. All objects are rendered using the Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm with eight-way symmetry, and collision is detected using AABB logic.
